# Basic Dice APP

I Create this simple application as a personal practice to demonstrate your acquired knowledge of javascript in the browser.

Only use nodejs for running a real-time sass compiler (watcher).

Simply click on the central button "Roll" and the app will generate a random number between 1 and 6.

Do not use animations changing the src of the dice using 6 images for the same reason, there are 6 images that cause problems in the performance of the system. However it can be done perfectly.
